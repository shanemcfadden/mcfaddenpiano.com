# mcfaddenpiano.com

This project started when I outgrew SquareSpace. Although it was a wonderful way for me to design and deploy a website when I was working full time as a musician, there was no need for me to pay an annual fee for me to use someone else's template once I learned the basics of front-end development. In addition, I have complete freedom to add, delete, or customize any pages or features at my own convenience.

[mcfaddenpiano.com](https://mcfaddenpiano.com) is a static website for my freelance music work built using Gatsby. It contains a bio, photos, videos, and a contact form.
